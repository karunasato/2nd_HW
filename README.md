# My Portfolio

This is my updated portfolio.

I updated my profile in the "About Me" section, to include my photo bio, links to GitHub, LinkedIn, resume, and e-mail address.

The portflio page has also been updated to include 3 completed projects with the description of the project, and links to the deployed application.

The contact page has been updated where users may add their information such as their name, e-mail address, and write their message. Also I made slight changes for the theme for consistancy.
